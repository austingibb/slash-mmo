# slash-mmo

TODO (in order of priority):
	- rewrite client
	- integrate modularity on the client side with browserify so that require() can be used
	- make server also provide the page (with expressjs)
	- make eating food more fun
	- make killing another player much more visually interesting
	- rethink algorithm for determining who wins a cross over
	- make room teiring system (or just have multiple rooms, there is only one right now)
	- make login possible
	- calculate viewport serverside, and determine what data is relevant to send to each specific client (prevents cheating)
