# slash-mmo

TODO (in order of priority):
	<b>- rewrite client
	<b>- integrate modularity on the client side with browserify so that require() can be used
	<b>- make server also provide the page (with expressjs)
	<b>- make eating food more fun
	<b>- make killing another player much more visually interesting
	<b>- rethink algorithm for determining who wins a cross over
	<b>- make room teiring system (or just have multiple rooms, there is only one right now)
	<b>- make login possible
	<b>- calculate viewport serverside, and determine what data is relevant to send to each specific client (prevents cheating)
